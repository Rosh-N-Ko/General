tkinter has various methods , lets go through some of them 
1)Tk()
This is an equals method which makes a variable a a window
 2)var.mainloop()
 this allows the window to stay on until exit is called 
 3)window .geometry(width,height)
 this allows us to set the intial dimensions of the the window 
 4)window.resizable(width=true/false,height=true /false)
 if the condition is false the window size stays the same 
 5)window.title()
 to make a tile 
 6)colours
 colours can be stored in # urls like #f900b7
 store in them in string varaibles and then use those varaibles, then us ethe .configure method to use it as bg and forgreground-bg,forgreground
please remember to put a # sign 
7)label=Label("text",font=("naeme size"))
Thsi is  to create the text within the window


8)label.grid(row=,column=,padx=,sticky=Direction-eg.NW,SE)
position the label,padding ensures that text dont bump intoe each other 
sticky ensure stha tduring expansion the the placemet of the text stays the smae 

9)Frame 
frames is another leve of the label , like heading 3 
window is heading 1, label is helding 2 , and frame is heading 3
frame=Frame(window,height=,width=,bg=)

10)PIL(pillow)
for stroing parsing and displaying images in tkinter 
a)after importing the Image and and Image Tk () from the model
b)store the image in a variable like so 
img=Image.open('name.png')
c)you can resize the image like so 
img.resize((100,100))
d)then put that image through tkinter trhough imageTk.PhotoImage like so 
img=imageTk.PhotoImage(img)


e)now this image is approprate for a tkinter window ,make it a label  

then put the img in a label like so 
imag=Label(window,height=100,image=img)
f)place the label 
imag.place(x=5,y=10)

11)COmbobox
the rolling list thing , this is in ttk 
set a variable = Combobox(location-farme body,height=,width=,font)
height=number of option syou want at disolay
width=how much you wanna display through each option
Things to do with Combobox:
a)place=
name.place(x=,y=)
b)values=(the option sheld-like a,b,c etc)
name['values']=["a","b","c"]

c)name.current(0)
here the 0 is index from the range of values 
so i cant say 4, , as 4 can exist in abc (3 elements including 0)


12)radiobutton
looks like a targetr button 
made like this 
rad=Radiobutton(frame,value=1,fg=,bg=,font=(),text ,command =)
the value of the radiobutton can be changed , by setting it according to an int variable 
most importantly you can run commands , where whn you touch the button , some action happens,this is the point of th e button  
commands accepts functions and when you are writing that as theh input for the command you dont need to write the bracketsto call them
func()
rad=Radiobutton(command=func)
the above statement is acceptable 



13)mixer
mixer is a module from  pygame.it allows you to put in music into your guis
a)import mixer form pygame 
b)define a method ,which will call upon the fuctionalities of mixer 
    def play():

c) mixer.music.load('name.mp3')\
    mixer.music.play()
d)mixer.init()
always initialise the mixer 
e)now call the fucntion ,and put in the tkinter file , idk 
f)stop
when you wanna stop the music , run mixer.music.stop


 14)time-sleep(1)
 sleep is a function in the time library that loops a block of code fucntion after a time period as specified 
 sleep(1)
 here you loop after one second 

14)Thread
thread helps you run a target function in the background,all you have to do is to define the target and the run the method 
like so :
a)t=Thread(target=func)
t.start()
