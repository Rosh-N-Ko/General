import tkinter 
import tkinter.ttk
import datetime 
import sleep from time 
window ,frame line and frame body are all divisions that you can give the total window , so it allows for jurisdiction for differnent elemenets 

1)make the window with Tk()
2) add a frameline (mess with the grid a lil bit to see where it takes you )
3) Add a frame body 

4)the colours  and stuff , and run the main window  

5)Use PIL to get the icon needed for your tkinter project , resize that image 
6)update all of this in tkinter learn
7)configure image 
8)place the configured image ,into a the label , with the right proprtions 
9)give an alarm title inside tghe window,and label the function of hour , minutes and seconds   


10)that rolling list is known as a combo box ,add that to seconds , minutes and hours and then set those values  
11)combo box funcs-value ,current , place 

12)radiobutton 

13)use mixer for getting the music
creat a function to play the music ,configuere th econtrol flow and use that specific situation to play the alarm  
 



14)use threads for allowing code to run in the background without being inetrfer , when the rest of the gui is functioning ,eg.mainloop(its not a thread but it works like that ) 
simce hread run in the background they'll get the time in tjh ebackground and use that data to compare the time given  
so create a thread , keep the target as the alarm fuction and run the thread (the thread is in a fuction ) which will run the alarm 


15)use a controls flow to make sure that the time is equal to the option chosen and then rrun the music method
run it in an infinite loop on the condition that the radiobutton is on (it is 1)\
andproint that it is to take a break 


16)define a command in the radiobuton to activate the alarm 
17)make a nother radiobutton to deactivate the alarm and put that in the  fuction that has the mixer stuff in it , so the option to deactivate will come when the music is played 
so that you can now the stop the alarm 
the vlue here must be 2, the command is to the ofiunction to deactivate the alarm 

logic-(compare the current time , with the time provided by comboboxes ,the way you do that is to use the get funcytion on the specifc combobox (eg roll_s ),rolls.get()    )
18)after making the
