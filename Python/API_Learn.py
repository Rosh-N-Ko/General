Concepts 
API-Application programmable Interface
REST-Representational State Transfer

 
 
1)API 
Interface meaning pproviding a level of abstraction ,Like the waiter .Helps you deal interact with complicated software , without knowing how it works .
Just knowing that it works  
You dont know how the chef is making the food .But it is being made and you tell the waiter what you want, and they make it fo you 
YOu interact with the software , without every detail of how it works 
Intefaces abstract the Implementation 
You dont need to know how it is doing things , but you do need to know how to write an implementation , to what the framework is expecting 

2)REST
APS are advantageous cause 
1)Local machine does not need to have or run code (so its not bloated)
2)Computational power of other servers is being used (so its ill be fast )
3)SOfware is abstracted away from he user , thus you can use the data it gives or interations for your website 
    There are a few guiding principles that define wht a REST-ful API is 
 a)Client server architecture 
 b)Statelessness
 c)Layered System 
 d)Cacheability
 e)Uniform design 
 f)Code on Demand    
 
 Most applications are built on the base of data and resources that play around with that data in the following ways 
 These are done through these respective HTTP verbs , the  requests between the client and the API  
 Creating -Post()
 Reading -Get()
 updating -put(),patch()
 deleting -delete()
)))

Steps for the API
a)define a variable with the base url 
and another with the api key or json extension
b)make a variable and use the get function with the base and extension and call the json method 
c)now you have all the data-Pune 
d)define another variable,associate that with the entire data and get 
a list called ['links']-Wadi
e)return these links (if used in a method and go ahead)-Pune
f) in a new method ,to get the data that you wish to,get the link,and associate it with a list of the data you wish to have
