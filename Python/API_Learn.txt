1.Requests
start by importng the requests module this allows you the base to get and set data 
2)in case of simple readme link 
what i mean by a read me link is that the url leads you to few lines of the data that you need
 rather than something more systemised 
3)Make a fuction to access the info(optional)
4)assign the link to a variable -------l="url"
5)then use a get request (which is a function ) to get the info in that link which will be 
stored as a string
    -----r=requests.get(l)
6)convert that string into a dictionary through a json method
    j=r.json()    
7)now you will most probably get many keys, and now store the value of those keys  
get the value from a the approproiate key ,and store it in the format you like 
    val=float(j['Key1'])
    here the square brackets are needed as you are using a dicionary  and float is the dataytpe youi want 
    alspo you canb then format how it is diplayed eg.since we are getting a float and it happens to be a big flopat , you can format itr as so 
    so 
        form="${:,.3f}
        ':'allows the formmatter to parse the staement 
        the comma puts comma in ther ight places 
        and .3f shows us how many floating are displayed in
