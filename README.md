# General
This is wher i plan to code , my crashes and burns and smaller less polished ,yet all the more important projects to biuld consistency in my skill,
so as to experiment enough to move on to bigger and better projects .FEel free to look around , but these projects mostly consist of my feeble attempts to
solve small math based problems along with clearing some concepts 

Going through it is a little rough , as by this time i have not reached industry standards in terms comment ettiquette, but my future projects will 
feature a better version of this
