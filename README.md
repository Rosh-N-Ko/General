This is where I plan to code my crashes and burns and smaller, less polished snippets of code, as well as some of the more important projects to build consistency in my skill, so as to experiment enough to move on to bigger and better projects .Feel free to look around, but these projects mostly consist of my attempts at problem solving, And clearing mathematics based problems.
Going through it is a little rough, as by this time I have not reached industry standards in terms comment etiquette, but my future projects will feature a better version of this
