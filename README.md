# General
This is where i plan to code my crashes and burns and smaller  ,less polished snippetsof code ,as well as some of  the more important projects to biuld consistency in my skill,
so as to experiment enough to move on to bigger and better projects .Feel free to look around , but these projects mostly consist of my attempts at problem solving  ,And clearing mathematics based problems.  

Going through it is a little rough , as by this time i have not reached industry standards in terms comment ettiquette, but my future projects will 
feature a better version of this
